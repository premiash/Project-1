Project proposal
-----------------
Project title
	TBD: "My Virtual Fridge"
Project description
	Utilizing Voice recognition to determine what recipes can be made with food currently in fridge
Team members

	Abhishek Mukherjee
	Ubtene Zamaninia
	Julia Ji
	Ashmy Selvamony

Sketch of final report
	Application that uses voice recognition to input data. Application focuses on using the ingredients you currently have in your fridge to make a meal. Using food2fork we can use AJAX calls to select the specific ingredients we have. Then the api displays the different recipes we can make using only the ingredients we currently have. Possible extra functionality will be additional recipes with extra ingredients suggested. All ingredients will be stored in a firebase database requiring user authentication. This will let you view what ingredients you have in your fridge at any time from any source. When you make a recipe, ingredients will automatically be removed from the virtual fridge. When you come back to the app to make your next meal, you won't have to re-add the ingredients you still have in the fridge. You will be able to manually delete items as well. When you go shopping, you will be able to add ingredients to your fridge in real time via voice or text.

APIs to be used
	food2fork API
	Google Cloud speech API (uses gCloud console)

High breakdown of tasks
	Ashmy + Julia focusing on front end initially, creating intial html framework for application. Also doing research into Google Cloud Speech API
	Abhishek + Ubtene focusing on logic and backend initially, researching how both APIs work and how to best integrate into our project. Researching Modals. 
	Group will be psuedocoding the logic and and framework together on Thursday. 
	Once initial framework is done, group communicates and figures out how best to code the logic and start actual JS code.
